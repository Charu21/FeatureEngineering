### Project Statement:

While searching for the dream house, the buyer looks at various factors, not just at the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.
Using the dataset, find the factors that influence price negotiations while buying a house.
There are 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

### Tasks performed: 

⦁	Understand the dataset:
  -	Identify the shape of the dataset
  -	Identify variables with null values
  -	Identify variables with unique values

⦁	Generate a separate dataset for numerical and categorical variables

⦁	EDA of numerical variables:
  -	Missing value treatment
  -	Identify the skewness and distribution
  -	Identify significant variables using a correlation matrix 
  -	Pair plot for distribution and density

⦁	EDA of categorical variables
  -	Missing value treatment
  -	Count plot for bivariate analysis
  -	Identify significant variables using p-values and Chi-Square values

⦁	Combine all the significant categorical and numerical variables

⦁	Plot box plot for the new dataset to find the variables with outliers
